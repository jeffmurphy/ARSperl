BM   removed most of the PPERLC and AWP stuff that was intended
	   to help the port to ActiveState perl.  Use the One True Perl.
BM   Changed many of the allocations to use perl's memory manager,
 	   except where the structure or element is grown further internally
	   by ARS, or where the structure is non-trivial to free().  I still
	   have concerns about some of the un-freed allocations in 
	   supportrev.c, but at least ALL of the demo scripts, 
	   including ARSDoc-1.11 (with small patch submitted to list) now 
	   run, and produce the right results.
BM   Removed all references to ZEROMEM in favor of perl's Zero, which
	   is guaranteed to work everywhere, and doesn't need additional logic.
BM   fixed a couple of small typos, including one in a elliptical 
	   declaration (...) which didn't have a comma separator.
BM   Changed the logic of CVLD in one place that was attempting to free()
	   null pointers.

           accessed. $ars_errstr no longer tie'd to main:: package.
JCM bug fix (Sid Van den Heede) "affecting getting of
           displayInstanceList"
JCM bug fix (James LewisMoss) for ars_GetCharMenu()
JCM bug fix (Ian Flanigan) for perl_ARIndexStruct()
JCM modified GetListEntry(), GetEntry(), SetEntry() and 
           DeleteEntry() to make operations on join schemas 
           transparent.
JCM added a ARVerifyUser call to ars_Login so that
           ars_Login() || die() will work as one would expect it to.
JCM added $VERSION to the perl module file.
JCM added "log to file" action to GetFilter action hash 
           (requested by {D.J.Adams at soton.ac.uk})
JCM added updated doc tree to main distribution (contributed by
	   {D.J.Adams at soton.ac.uk})
JCM new functions and doc on new functions and new examples for some
	   of these new functions.
!JCM altered return value of perl_ARStatusStruct so that it 
           returns a hash of the various StatusStruct members so that
           reversing the operation is simpler. scripts that, for example,
           retrieve active link definitions and print them out that previous
           expected the {message} key to point to a string will need to
           be updated.
JCM added valueType to the assign structure to assist in 
           reversing the operation (converting perl to C API assign 
           structure).
JCM added displayTag as an optional parameter to ars_LoadQualifier()
           so that you can build queries against customized views (that
           are stored on the server).
JCM altered ARError() so that return codes of OK or WARNING don't
           signal an error. For example, GetListEntries would return
           nothing if you matched more than the max allowed, now it returns
           the max allowable number of records and places a warning message
           into the error hash.
