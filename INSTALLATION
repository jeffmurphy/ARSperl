---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a perl extension for Remedy's Action Request System. Remedy
Corporation, Action Request System, and AR System are trademarks of Remedy 
Corporation.

This extension is offered completely for free and without support
of any kind. Use at you own risk!  

PREPARATION

You will need to have these already installed: 

   o  ARS 2.x or 3.x API libraries and includes (header files).
   o  Perl 5.x with the dynamic loading option compiled in.

TESTED OS'S

This extension has been successfully built and used under the following 
OS versions:

   o  Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1
   o  SunOS 4.1.3
   o  Irix 6.2
   o  HPUX*
   o  WindowsNT  (But NOT win95)
   o  Linux

Users of other OS's might encounted problems with compiling. We'd be 
interested in hearing about your experiences and if you got it working
under a new OS. 

* Must be built statically under HP-UX. See the FAQ pages at
  http://arsinfo.cit.buffalo.edu/perl/FAQs/index.html
  for details.

BUILDING

To build the extension, change into the root directory of the distribution
and edit the Makefile.PL file. Change the following lines in it to point to
the location of your ARS API directory (e.g. /u/remedy/api/lib)

$ARSAPI = "/usr/ars/api";

Under Sunos 4.1.x, you will also need to add -lntc to $ARS_LIBS.
Under Irix 6.2, you will need to remove the -lnsl option from $ARS_LIBS.
Under HP-UX, you will need to build it statically into Perl.
Under WindowsNT you will need to insert the appropriate libraries
(arapi.lib and nts.lib) from the API kit included with NT Server, 
and the path to the include files, into Makefile.pl (or the resulting
Makfile).  
For ARS2.0, you will need to add -DARS20 to the DEFINEs line.

then execute the following comands:

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install

The first command will construct a Makefile. For the actual compile, an 
ANSI compatible C compiler is needed. We use GCC (2.7.2). The third command
might require special (i.e. root) access if your installed perl
distribution is not owned by your userid.

You may occasionally get a "bad free()" error message, or a segmentation
fault.  I am pretty sure I fixed all the causes of this, but there
may be more bugs lurking.  To prevent this from ever happening, and
waste a lot of memory in the process, you can add the option
"-DWASTE_MEM" to the 'DEFINE' in Makefile.PL.  (Also, please report
this if it happens!)

You can also define -DPROFILE if you wish to have profiling statistics
kept during script runtime (query stats). There is minimal overhead,
and this is enabled by default.  Note that profiling is not yet enabled on 
NT.  It must be turned off when building.
